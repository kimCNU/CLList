 * <h1>Asg2: Linked List</h1>
 * <h2>Objectives</h2>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>develop your ability to implement a Linked List given its ADT</li>
 * <li>improve your ability to write JUnit tests</li>
 * <li>improve your ability to write readable code according to best practices
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h2>Introduction</h2>
 * <p>
 * The CListADT defines the API for a list of Characters. Note that a newly
 * created CListADT is EMPTY.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A Character is located at a position in the CListADT. One of the Characters
 * is the current Character. A CListADT has methods to manage its list of
 * Characters (details of the methods are given below).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Your task is to implement this ADT, develop a JUnit test class, and document
 * both using Javadoc.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Instructions</h2>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Study the LList.java and Link.java code in the textbook.</li>
 * <li>Your implementation should store Character references NOT Object
 * references.</li>
 * <li>Your implementation should NOT use generics.</li>
 * <li>Write the Javadoc for the JUnit class and the implementation.</li>
 * <li>Write the JUnit tests for the ADT described by this API.</li>
 * <li>Implement, using a LINKED LIST, the ADT described by this API.</li>
 * <li>You may NOT use any pre-existing classes such as List, ArrayList,
 * etc.</li>
 * <li>Submit your files to Web-CAT using the eclipse menu "Project->Submit
 * Assignment..."</li>
 * <li>To see my comments after I've graded your work, or to see your results at
 * any time, login to http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
 * <p>
 * Develop preliminary JUnit tests before you implement the methods, using the
 * process described in class and the slides. For example, develop tests for a
 * method, implement the method, run the tests. Do this until the method passes
 * the tests. Go on to the next method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you may have to implement a little bit as well in order to write
 * your JUnit tests. The process involves switching between JUnit tests and
 * implementation, in order to develop a good understanding of the problems to
 * be solved.
 * </p>
 * </p>
 * <h2>NOTES</h2>
 * <p>
 * <li>Any submission that is not a linked list implementation will receive NO
 * CREDIT.</li>
 * <li>Any submission that that uses pre-existing classes like ArrayList will
 * receive NO CREDIT.</li>
 * <li>You may submit as many times as you like until the deadline.</li>
 * <li>The grade of your latest submission will be the one recorded.</li>
 * <li><b>Disregard the Web-CAT correctness grade. I will compute it
 * differently.</b></li>
 * </ul>
